    "# N-Queens\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The **N-Queens problem** is a classical combinatorial challenge of placing $N$ queens on an $N \\times N$ chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This implies that each row, column, and diagonal must contain **exactly one queen**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Translating this to the quantum domain involves encoding valid queen placements as quantum states and designing quantum circuits to enforce the constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm/System Design\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the N-Queens problem quantumly, three main constraints must be encoded:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Row Constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row is initialized to a **uniform superposition** of all basis states with exactly one qubit in the $\\lvert 1 \\rangle$ state, representing one queen per row. For $N = 2^n$, this requires constructing a specific quantum state:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\lvert \\psi \\rangle = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\lvert R_k \\rangle\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $R_k$ corresponds to a single queen in a given row. A specific circuit was built and verified for the **4-queens** case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Column Constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure exactly one queen per column, $N - 1$ ancillary qubits are introduced. Each ancilla is initialized in a $\\lvert + \\rangle$ state using Hadamard gates. Then, **controlled-phase operations** are applied using the qubits of each column as control and the respective ancilla as target.\n",
    "\n",
    "A final Hadamard transformation reveals whether a column has an even or odd number of queens. The last column is inferred based on the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diagonal Constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "For diagonal checks, each possible diagonal is examined using **Toffoli gates**. An ancilla initialized to $\\lvert 1 \\rangle$ is flipped if two qubits on the same diagonal are both in $\\lvert 1 \\rangle$, indicating a violation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A total of $\\frac{N(N-1)}{2}$ ancilla qubits are required for all diagonal checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- **4-Queens**: Implemented successfully using **25 qubits** (16 board qubits + 6 diagonal ancilla + 3 column ancilla). *[Code link]*  \n",
    "- **8-Queens**: Adapted the row initialization circuit from the 4-queens version. Column and diagonal constraints follow a similar structure. **Total qubits required**: 99. *[Code link]*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantum circuit approach to the N-Queens problem showcases the potential of encoding classical constraint satisfaction problems into quantum systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main bottleneck is **qubit scalability**, as the circuit requires $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ qubits for the board and additional ancillas for constraints. However, once the base 4-queen structure is established, the system scales **modularly**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of controlled-phase shifts and multi-qubit Toffoli gates ensures that constraint violations can be detected using **ancilla measurements**, aligning with quantum verification paradigms.\n"

    "The **Max-Cut problem** is a well-known NP-hard problem in graph theory.

In the quantum domain, this problem can be encoded as an optimization task and solved using the **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)**, which leverages parameterized quantum circuits to approximate the solution to combinatorial optimization problems.\n",

    "QAOA demonstrates a promising framework for quantum approximate solutions to NP-hard problems like Max-Cut. Even shallow circuits (low $p$-values) achieve competitive results, especially on small graphs. The algorithm’s performance is heavily influenced by the choice of variational parameters, highlighting the importance of efficient classical-quantum hybrid optimization. While QAOA scales polynomially in circuit depth, real-world application on larger graphs is currently limited by quantum hardware constraints. However, the modular and interpretable nature of the QAOA circuit design makes it a valuable testbed for future advances in variational quantum algorithms.\n"

    "# QFT\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computing offers exponential speedup for certain problems, one of the most fundamental operations being the **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)**. The QFT is a critical component in quantum algorithms such as Shor's Algorithm for integer factorization, quantum simulation, and quantum machine learning. However, implementing the QFT efficiently on quantum hardware is a non-trivial task, especially with constraints imposed by hardware connectivity. The **Linear Nearest Neighbor (LNN)** architecture, a common connectivity model for quantum devices, presents challenges in constructing quantum circuits with low depth and high fidelity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This work aims to develop an efficient synthesis method for implementing the QFT on quantum devices with linear nearest neighbor (LNN) connectivity. The key challenge addressed is how to design the QFT circuit such that it adheres to LNN constraints, while minimizing the total number of gates and maintaining the required quantum state transformations. Additionally, the work considers the potential for approximations in the QFT implementation to reduce gate complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm/System Design\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm used to synthesize the QFT circuit for a quantum system with LNN connectivity follows the approach described by Fowler et al. (2004). The key steps in the design are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### QFT Circuit Construction:\n",
    "The QFT operation is designed as a series of quantum gates, including Hadamard gates (H), controlled-X gates (CX), and phase gates. For a system with $N$ qubits, the QFT is performed by applying a Hadamard gate to each qubit followed by a series of controlled-phase rotations between qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling LNN Connectivity:\n",
    "Quantum hardware with LNN architecture restricts the qubits that can directly interact (i.e., they can only interact with neighboring qubits). To address this, the circuit must be synthesized in a way that respects these connectivity constraints. The synthesis algorithm uses controlled-phase rotations and controlled-X gates, but also integrates swap gates when necessary to ensure that qubits can interact even if they are not direct neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approximation:\n",
    "To further optimize the circuit, the algorithm supports an approximation degree that allows the omission of certain controlled-phase rotations that fall below a threshold. This reduces the gate complexity while still achieving a result that is sufficiently close to the exact QFT.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reversal Network:\n",
    "In cases where the circuit does not include swaps, a reversal network is used to reorder the qubits at the end of the QFT operation, ensuring the correct quantum state is obtained in accordance with LNN constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Circuit Parameters:\n",
    "The number of gates required for the QFT circuit is computed based on the number of qubits and the approximation degree. The primary gates used in the synthesis are Hadamard, controlled-X, and phase gates, with controlled-phase gates being the key component for implementing the QFT.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed QFT synthesis algorithm was implemented for quantum systems with up to 8 qubits on an LNN architecture. The results were analyzed by comparing the total number of gates required for various approximation degrees, and the depth of the circuits was evaluated. The key findings include:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gate Count:\n",
    "- For $N = 4$ qubits, the synthesized QFT circuit required a total of 25 gates, including controlled-phase and controlled-X gates, along with Hadamard gates.\n",
    "- For $N = 8$ qubits, the gate count increased to 99 gates, highlighting the scalability of the algorithm for larger systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approximation Performance:\n",
    "The circuit performance was compared for different approximation degrees. As the approximation degree increased, the number of gates required decreased, but the fidelity of the QFT operation was also reduced. For small $N$ (e.g., $N = 4$), the approximation had a negligible effect on the outcome, but for larger systems, the approximation allowed for significant gate reduction without substantial loss of accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Qubit Reordering:\n",
    "The inclusion of the reversal network in the absence of swap gates effectively ensured the proper output qubit ordering, essential for LNN hardware.\n"
